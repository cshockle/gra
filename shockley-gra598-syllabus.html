              Learning takes place best when a safe environment is established in the classroom. Students enrolled in this course have a responsibility to support an environment that nurtures individual and group differences and encourages engaged, honest discussions. The success of the course rests on your ability to create a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable to share and explore ideas. We must also be willing to ask critical questions. Doing so will effectively contribute to our own and others intellectual and personal growth. We welcome disagreements in the spirit of critical academic exchange, but please remember to be respectful of others’ viewpoints, whether you agree with them or not.</p>
            <p class="not-so-wide">Students should feel free to ask questions anytime during class. Also, the participation of students during group discussions is strongly encouraged. However, off-task talking is disruptive to others and therefore prohibited. In addition, working on home assignment (either for GRA225 or other classes) is not allowed. Violator will be marked down 5 points (out of 100) per lecture after one warning.</p>

		        <p class="not-so-wide">Students are entitled to receive instruction free from interference by other members of the class. If a student is disruptive, an instructor may ask the student to stop the disruptive behavior and warn the student that such disruptive behavior can result in withdrawal from the course.

            <p class="not-so-wide">ASU policy prohibits discrimination, harassment or retaliation on the basis of race, sex, gender identity, age, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, and veteran status. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employees or expulsion of students. Contact the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities
            (480-965-6547) if you feel another student is harassing you based on any of the factors above; contact the Office of Equity and Inclusion (480-965-5057) if you feel an ASU employee is harassing you based on any of the factors above.

            <p class="not-so-wide">Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support,   from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources <a href="http://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs/students">here</a></p>

          <div id="topic9" class="targetDiv">
            <p class="not-so-wide">Students who believe they have a current and essential need for disability accommodations are responsible for requesting accommodations and providing qualifying documentation to the DRC <a href="http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/ed/drc/">here</a>. If you are a student in need of special arrangements, we will do all we can to help, based on the recommendations of these services. For the sake of equity for all students, we cannot make any accommodations without formal guidance from these services. Typically, once a student discloses the need for an accommodation through their study abroad application, the ASU Study Abroad Office, the academic unit, the student and DRC will develop a plan on how to best accommodate the student within the parameters available within the on-site locations. </p>
            <p class="not-so-wide">The provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, do not apply outside of the United States, so students with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation in a given ASU study abroad program location to be very different from what is found in the United States. Upon request, the ASU Study Abroad Office can provide information about the availability of accommodations and accessible facilities on the specific program and can help the student determine whether the student’s preferred program can meet the student’s accommodation needs. Students with disabilities should understand that the ASU Study Abroad Office cannot guarantee access to public transportation, buildings, or public sites on this program. </p>
            <p class="not-so-wide">Qualified students with disabilities may be eligible to receive academic support services and accommodations during the study abroad program. Eligibility is based on qualifying disability documentation and assessment of individual need. Every effort is made to provide reasonable accommodations for qualified students with disabilities, although the nature of the accommodations that can be provided by ASU during your study abroad program will depend on a number of variables, including but not limited to availability of resources on-site, accessibility of program facilities, and any study abroad requirement of the student’s degree program.

            <p class="not-so-wide">If you fail to meet the standards of academic integrity in any of the criteria listed on the university policy website, sanctions will be imposed by the instructor, school, and/or dean. Academic dishonesty includes borrowing ideas without proper citation, copying others’ work (including information posted on the internet), and failing to turn in your own work for group projects. Please be aware that if you follow an argument closely, even if it is not directly quoted, you must provide a citation to the publication, including the author, date and page number. If you directly quote a source, you must use quotation marks and provide the same sort of citation for each quoted sentence or phrase.  You may work with other students on assignments, however, all writing that you turn in must be done independently.  If you have any doubt about whether the form of cooperation you contemplate is acceptable, ask the TA or the instructor in advance of turning in an assignment. Please be aware that the work of all students submitted electronically can be scanned using SafeAssignment, which compares them against everything posted on the internet, online article/paper databases, newspapers and magazines, and papers submitted by other students (including yourself if submitted for a previous class).
            </p class="not-so-wide">
            <p class="not-so-wide">Note: Turning in an assignment (all or in part) that you completed for a previous class is considered self-plagiarism and falls under these guidelines. Any infractions of self-plagiarism are subject to the same penalties as copying someone else’s work without proper citations. Students who have taken this class previously and would like to use the work from previous assignments should contact the instructor for permission to do so. <a href="http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity">For more information</a></p>
            <p class="not-so-wide" class="red">Signing attendance for your classmate is considered academic misconduct. Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated. Any student caught committing these infractions will automatically fail this class.
